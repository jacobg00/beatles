        <h1>Beatles Project Method Page</h1>
        <h2>This page contains the steps for the making of our Beatles Project</h2>
        <p>1. We started by finding a CSV file on GitHub that contained the Beatles' discography. There was the song name, album, release date,year,lyrics,cover,songwriters and vocals.</p>
        <p>2. We then worked on converting the file to an XML file to where we could easily access the information. The complete list of steps taken when making the XML can be found at our stpes file. </p>
        <p>3. While creating the XML, we created a Schema to help check our code. </p>
        <p>4. From there we created a the html files that contains the various types of data that we have.</p>
        <p>5. We then found data that had the Beatles songs that were on BillBoard charts that we could help use toward our project. </p>
