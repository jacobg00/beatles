        <h1>Song Lyrics: Modality Score</h1>
        <p>As we considered the lyrical content of the Beatles songs, we started to wonder: Which
            Beatles songs are most typical, most quintessentially "Beatles", in their vocabulary?
            Calculating this turned out to be possible, but very tricky, and it required us to
            break the problem into several smaller steps, generating three separate XQuery document
            and two ancillary XML documents along the way. Here are our steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we needed to write an XQuery to string together the lyrics from all the songs,
                and then to "tokenize" the text (divide the lyrics into individual words). It would
                then count the frequency of each word across the entire corpus of Beatles lyrics.
                The first version of this created [link Vince's XQuery and HTML output here], for
                visual display; the second version [link WHC XQuery here] instead created a new XML
                file [link here] with the same data. This assigned each word an "overall frequency
                score" indicating how common it was across the whole discography.</li>
            <li>Second, we needed to run [link here] a similar XQuery to count the frequency of each
                word on a song-by-song basis. This generated [link here] another new XML file in which
                each song had a list of the words used in it, and the number of times each one was
                used.</li>
            <li>Third, and offering the greatest challenge of the three, was a new XQuery [link] to
                generate the HTML page you are reading right now, and especially the table below.
                On a song-by-song basis, it cross-references the two new XML files. As it loops over
                each song (excluding instrumentals, which have no lyrics), it looks at the frequency
                of each word in that song, and then multiplies that by the frequency of that word's
                use in the whole discography. We then took the average of those multiples across the
                song.
                </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In practice, here is what that means:</p>
        <p>The word "you" is used 2073 times across the discography. It appears 11 times in the song "All I've Got to Do". That means that, in that song, we multiply
            2073 times 11 to get 22803. This high number means that the song has used a very common word a large number
            of times. This contributes to a higher score for the song, meaning that is closer
            to the "modal" -- that is, the most typical -- Beatles song, as measured by word use
            frequency.</p>
        <p>At the same time, looking at the same song, the word "whisper" only once, and "whisper"
            is an uncommon word in the discography overall, appearing just 6 times. Its appearance in the song "All I've Got to Do" is therefore only worth 2073 points.</p>
        <p>When we average these calculations for all the words in the song, we arrive at a final
            score for that song, which can be compared to all the other songs. Songs, then, that
            use more words like "you", and fewer words like "whisper", will have a higher modality
            score.</p>
        <h1>And the winner is...</h1>
        <p>...a song you may never have heard of: "I Want You (She's So Heavy)", with an exceedingly
            high score of just under 8200. (For context, only a handful of songs have scores exceeding
            2000, and only one other song, "I Wanna Be Your Man", exceeds 4000.) What could possibly
            account for a song being both the most linguistically typical of all Beatles songs,
            and yet also an obscure deep cut from the Abbey Road album?</p>
        <p>The answer is simple: there are very few different words used; almost all of them
            are very common words; and they are repeated over and over. If you wanted to write
            a song to rack up the maximum score, this is exactly how you would do it.</p>
        <p>In a sense, then, "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" really is an outlier that "wins" top
            score by a kind of linguistic accident. This simple calculation did not take into
            account the many other factors that a proper linguistic analysis would include. Yet
            if we eliminate this one song and look at the other songs scoring over 2000, most
            of them do turn out to be more familiar, more in line with what one might imagine
            to be the Beatles archetype.</p>
