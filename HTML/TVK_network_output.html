            gonna make me a big star 'Cause I can play the part so well Well I hope you'll come and
            see me in the movies Then I know that you will plainly see The biggest fool that ever

            that's sad and lonely And begging down upon his bended knee I'll play the part and I
            won't need rehearsing All I gotta do is act naturally Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a
            big star Might win an Oscar you can never tell The movies gonna make me a big star

            Like the boys all play Hold tight, tap your foot Don't let it carry you away Don't let

            something sure is wrong Cos I'm so blue and lonely I forgot to remember to

   <lyrics>Deep down in Louisianna Close to New Orleans Way back up in the woods Among the
            evergreens There stand a country cabin Made of clay and wood Where lives a young country
            boy Named Johnny B. Goode He never ever learned To read or write a book so well But he
            could play his guitar Just like a-ringing a bell Go go, go Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go
            go go! Go Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Aah Johnny B. Goode! He used to carry his
            guitar In a gunny sack Sit beneath the trees By the railroad track Oh sitting and
            a-playing In the shade Drumming to the rhythm That the drivers made People passing by
            Used to stop and say My oh my That country boy can play Go go, go Johnny go go go! Go
            Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Aah Johnny B. Goode! Well his
            mama told him Someday you will be a man And you will be the leader Of a big old band
            Many people coming From miles around To hear you play your music Till the sun goes down
            Maybe some day Your name will be in light Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight! Go go, go
            Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Go Johnny go go go! Aah Johnny
            B. Goode!</lyrics>

            rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too Well, here's something for you to do
            Get a shot of rhythm and blues With just a little rock and roll on the side Just for
            good measure Get a pair of dancing shoes Well, with your lover by your side Don't you
            know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure? Don't you worry about a thing if you start to
            dance and sing And chills coming up on you And if the rhythm finally gets you and the
            beat gets you too Well, here's something for you to do Get a shot of rhythm and blues
            Get a pair of dancing shoes Get a shot of rhythm and blues Well, with your lover by your
            side Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure? Don't you worry about a thing
            if you start to dance and sing And chills coming up on you And if the rhythm finally
            gets you and the beat gets you too Well, here's something for you to do Well, here's
            something for you to do Well, here's something for you to do</lyrics>

   <lyrics>A taste of honey. Tasting much sweeter than wine. I dream of your first kiss and
            then, I feel upon my lips again, A taste of honey. Tasting much sweeter than wine. I
            will return, Yes I will return, I'll come back For the honey, And you. Yours was the
            kiss that awoke my heart, There lingers still, 'though we're far apart, That taste of
            honey... Tasting much sweeter than wine. I will return, yes I will return, I'll come
            back For the honey, And you.</lyrics>
